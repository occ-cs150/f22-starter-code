/**
 * Write the function named countMatches().
 *
 * Write a function named countMatches that accepts a
 * string to match (as const char *), an array of strings (as const char*[]),
 * and the size of the array (as size_t), and returns the number of
 * strings in the array that contain the string to match as a substring.
 *
 * For example, if strs is defined as
 *  const char * strs[] = {"rainbow", "sunshine", "bowtie", "cow", "ow", "happy"};
 * then the call countMatches("ow", strs, 6) returns 4.
 *
 * The empty string is a substring of any string.
 * You may assume that the size argument correctly represents the size
 * of the array, and that the match string is not a nullptr.
 *
 * Do not use any functions from the standard library.
