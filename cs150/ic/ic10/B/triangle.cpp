    Write the recursive function triangle.

    We have pyramid made of blocks.
    The topmost row has 1 block, row beneath that
    has 2 blocks, the next row has 3 blocks,
    and so on. Compute recursively
    (no loops or multiplication) the total number
    of blocks in such a triangle with the given
    number of rows. Notice that if there are no
    blocks, your function should return 0.

        triangle(0) returns 0
        triangle(1) returns 1
        triangle(2) returns 3
